# Python-Programs-Involving-Wordle
I use public information available on the game 'Wordle' and make programs for various purposes

In the folder you will see 2 python programs and 2 .txt files

The .txt files are the answers to the game "Wordle"
The "Wordle_Answers.txt" file has only answers up to January 28th
The "All_Wordle_Answers.txt" file has all the answers from the the very first to the last planned answer (upto the year 2027)
Both were neccessary for the first python program as a way to test and see if it worked in 2 different cases

The "Most_Optimal_First_Guess.py" file uses the .txt files above to find the 5 most frequently used words and checks if a word can be created from them
The program gave the same answer(s) in both cases

The "Todays_Wordle_Answer.py" file uses the "All_Wordle_Answer.txt" to find the answer for today's date and outputs it
